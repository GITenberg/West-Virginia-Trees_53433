<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE">PREFACE</a></h2>


<p>The native trees of West Virginia number about 125, of which
101 are described and illustrated in this publication. The omissions
are principally species of unimportant willows and hawthorns which
can be identified only by specialists. Some of the more common
introduced trees are mentioned in the family descriptions on pages
13 to 27, and a few are illustrated in groups after the descriptions
of native species. It has been the object to simplify everything in
this publication as much as possible. The meaning of unfamiliar
words in the keys and descriptions can be learned by consulting the
glossary beginning on page <a href="#Page_237">237</a>.</p>

<p>The keys are based principally on characters of leaf and fruit
since these are usually available for study during several months in
the summer and fall. The text, however, contains brief descriptions
of the flowers which often denote most surely the natural relationship
of species.</p>

<p>Scientific names and the order of arrangement are essentially
those of the seventh edition of Gray’s New Manual of Botany.</p>

<p>The drawings were made by the writer from specimens collected
during the past few years.</p>

<p>This bulletin has been prepared mainly for those who desire
to become more familiar with our native and introduced trees, but
who do not have access to the larger publications on the subject.
It will serve also as a basis for future forestry studies in the State.
Popular interest in forestry, which is sadly lacking in West Virginia
at this time, will be stimulated by a more general and more intimate
acquaintance with the different kinds of trees. It is hoped that this
bulletin will help to create the needed interest. If difficulty is found
in determining the name of any tree, specimens mailed to the West
Virginia Agricultural Experiment Station, Morgantown, West Virginia,
will be named, if possible, without charge.</p>

<h2 id="PINACEAETHE_PINE_FAMILY">PINACEAE—THE PINE FAMILY</h2>


<p>The Pine family comprises nearly 300 species belonging to 34
genera, distributed principally in temperate regions throughout the
world. This family is of great economic importance, supplying a
larger quantity of lumber than any other family as well as enormous
amounts of tannin, turpentine, resin, tar and pitch. Many of its members
also are highly useful for ornamental purposes.</p>

<p>The leaves of the trees and shrubs belonging to the Pine family
are needle-shaped, awl-shaped, or scale-like, and are usually persistent
for more than one year, the American Larch or Tamarack being
the only exception to this rule in West Virginia. The seeds are borne
either in true cones, or in berry-like fruits such as are produced on the
cedars.</p>

<p>The following are the genera of Pinaceae represented in West
Virginia:</p>

<p><b>Pinus</b>.—Of the 34 species of pines native to North America only
5 are found in West Virginia. These are described and illustrated
on following pages. Besides the native pines several introduced
species are planted on lawns and in parks. The most common of the
exotics are Red Pine (<i>Pinus resinosa</i>, Ait.) and Scotch Pine (<i>Pinus
sylvestris</i>, L.), the former having smooth cones about 2 inches long
and leaves 4-6 inches long, two in a bundle, and the latter having
cones 1½-2½ inches long, and leaves 1½-3½ inches long, two in a
bundle.</p>

<p class="center">KEY TO THE SPECIES OF PINUS</p>


<ul class="trees">
<li class="i2ndh">Leaves 5 in a cluster; cones smooth, 4-10 inches long</li>
<li class="ipge"><b>P. strobus, p. <a href="#Page_29">29</a>.</b></li>

<li class="i2ndh">Leaves fewer than 5 in a cluster; cones less than 4 inches long.</li>

<li class="i3rdh">Leaves 3 in a cluster; cones with prickles</li>
<li class="ipge"><b>P. rigida, p. <a href="#Page_31">31</a>.</b></li>

<li class="i2ndh">Leaves 2 in a cluster.</li>

<li class="i3rdh">Leaves stiff, sharp-pointed, 2-4 inches long; cones 2-4 inches

<li class="ipge"><b>P. virginiana, p. <a href="#Page_37">37</a>.</b></li>

<li class="i4th">Leaves slender, not twisted, 3-4 inches long, often 3 in a cluster,
especially near the ends of twigs</li>
<li class="ipge"><b>P. echinata, p. <a href="#Page_35">35</a>.</b></li></ul>

<p><b>Larix</b>, (page <a href="#Page_39">39</a>).—There are 10 known species of Larches found
principally in the colder regions of the northern hemisphere. Three
of these are indigenous to North America and one extends as far
south as the northern part of West Virginia. Unlike most of the
members of the Pine family the Larches shed their leaves each fall.
The European Larch (<i>Larix decidua</i>, Mill.) is frequently planted for
ornamental purposes. It can be distinguished from the native species
by its much larger cones.</p>

<p><b>Picea</b>, (page <a href="#Page_41">41</a>).—Eight of the 18 or 20 known species of
Spruces are native to North America and one species is found in West
Virginia. The 2 introduced Spruces most commonly planted are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">14</span>
Norway Spruce (<i>Picea Abies</i>, (L.) Karst.) and Colorado Blue Spruce
(<i>Picea pungens</i>, Engl.). The Norway Spruce can be distinguished
from our native species by its much larger cones, and the Colorado
Blue Spruce by its blue-green foliage.</p>

<p><b>Tsuga</b>, (page <a href="#Page_43">43</a>).—This genus comprises 8 species, 4 of which
grow in Asia and 4 in North America. One of the 2 Eastern
Hemlocks is common in West Virginia, the other (<i>Tsuga caroliniana</i>,
Engl.) grows from the mountains of Virginia south to Georgia.</p>

<p><b>Abies</b>, (page <a href="#Page_45">45</a>).—The 25 known species of Firs are found
principally in cold and temperate regions. Of the 10 species in North
America only 2 are found east of the Rocky Mountains and 1 in
West Virginia. The other Eastern Fir is <i>Abies balsamea</i>, (L.) Mill,
which does not extend southward into this State.</p>

<p><b>Thuja</b>, (page <a href="#Page_47">47</a>).—Four species of Arbor Vitae are known, 2
of which are native to North America, one in the West and the other
in the East. The limited distribution in West Virginia of the latter
is given on the page describing this species.</p>

<p><b>Juniperus</b>, (page <a href="#Page_49">49</a>).—This is a large genus comprising 40
trees and shrubs. Of these, 16 species are found in North America.
Red Cedar, described in this bulletin, is common in West Virginia
and <i>Juniperus communis</i>, (L.) has been reported from Wood, Mineral
and Fayette counties.</p>

<p>Other members of the Pine family which may be seen occasionally
planted on lawns in West Virginia are the following:</p>

<p>White Cedar (<i>Chamaecyparis thyoides</i>, (L.) B.S.P.)</p>

<p>Bald Cypress (<i>Taxodium distichum</i>, Rich.)</p>

<p>Ginkgo Tree (<i>Ginkgo biloba</i>, (L.)) and several other species and
varieties of Junipers, Pines, Spruces, and Yews.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2 id="SALICACEAETHE_WILLOW_FAMILY">SALICACEAE—THE WILLOW FAMILY</h2>


<p>The Willow family, which includes also the Poplars, comprises
about 200 species, a large proportion of which are distributed in
temperate and arctic zones. Several shrubby species extend far into
the arctic regions.</p>

<p>On the whole this family is not important commercially, but with
the disappearance of the more valuable kinds of trees the rapid-growing
and easily-propagated Willows and Poplars are receiving more
attention.</p>

<p>The 2 genera belonging to this family are given below:</p>

<p><b>Salix</b>, (page <a href="#Page_51">51</a>).—This genus comprises no fewer than 175
known species, 100 of which are native to North America. The following
species are reported from West Virginia: <i>S. nigra</i>, Marsh., <i>S.
amygdaloides</i>, Aud., <i>S. discolor</i>, Muhl., <i>S. humilis</i>, Marsh., <i>S. cericea</i>,
Marsh. and <i>S. cordata</i>, Muhl. Doubtless several other species occur<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">15</span>
in the State. The task of determining the different species of Willows
is one for the specialist who has devoted much time to their
study. For this reason only one species, the common Black Willow
of our stream banks, is described and illustrated in this bulletin.
The most common introduced Willows are the well-known Weeping
Willow (<i>Salix babylonica</i>, (L.)) and a yellow-twigged variety of the
White Willow (<i>Salix alba</i>, var. <i>vitellina</i>, (L.) Koch.).</p>

<p><b>Populus</b>.—The species of Poplars and Aspens number 27 of
which 19 are native to North America and 3 to West Virginia.
White Poplar (<i>P. alba</i>, (L.)) and Balm of Gilead (<i>P. candicans</i>, Ait.) are
the principal introduced species planted in the State.</p>

<h2 id="JUGLANDACEAETHE_WALNUT_FAMILY">JUGLANDACEAE—THE WALNUT FAMILY</h2>


<p>The Walnut family, with its 6 genera and 35 species, is represented
in North America by 2 genera (Juglans and Carya) and 19
species. This family is a very important one, contributing much of
the costliest and most durable timber as well as large quantities of
edible nuts. The wood of Black Walnut is especially adapted to
fine cabinet work and that of the Hickories to the manufacture of
vehicles, handles, etc., where strength and flexibility are desired.</p>

<p><b>Juglans</b>.—The 15 species comprising this genus are found principally
in the north temperate zone. Five species are native to
North America and two are found in West Virginia. The English
Walnut (<i>Juglans regia</i>, (L.)) which has been introduced and widely
planted in the United States yields the valuable Circassian Walnut
woods used in the manufacture of fine furniture as well as the walnuts
sold in our markets.</p>

<p class="center">KEY TO THE SPECIES OF JUGLANS</p>

At least 5 of these are found in West Virginia. <i>Carya microcarpa</i>,
Nutt., not described herein is reported from Fayette County.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">16</span></p>

<h2 id="BETULACEAETHE_BIRCH_FAMILY">BETULACEAE—THE BIRCH FAMILY</h2>


<p>The 6 genera and about 75 species belonging to this family are
principally confined to the higher latitudes of the northern hemisphere.
In North America there are 5 genera and about 30 species,
of which the 5 genera and at least 9 species grow in West Virginia.
The Common Hazelnut (<i>Corylus americana</i>, Walt.) and the Beaked
Hazelnut (<i>Corylus rostrata</i>, Ait.) are both common shrubs of the
State. The Smooth Alder (<i>Alnus rugosa</i>, (DuRoi) Spreng.) and the
Hoary Alder (<i>Alnus incana</i>, (L.) Moench.) are both to be found,
the former abundant along our streams, and the latter rare in upland
swamps. <i>Alnus alnobetula</i> (Ehrh.) K K. is also reported from Greenbrier,
Fayette, and Randolph counties.</p>

<p>This family produces products of great value. The wood of
Birches is used extensively for furniture and interior finish, and for
fuel. Black Birch supplies a volatile oil of considerable importance.
The wood of some of the Alders is becoming valuable on account of
its use in the manufacture of gunpowder, and the fruits of the
Hazelnuts bring a good price on the market. The following are our
tree genera:</p>

<p><b>Ostrya</b>, (page <a href="#Page_73">73</a>).—Four species of Hop Hornbeam or Ironwood
are known, 2 being found in North America. One of these is
limited in its range to the Grand Canyon of the Colorado, in Arizona;
the other is widely distributed and is common locally in West Virginia.</p>

<p><b>Carpinus</b>, (page <a href="#Page_75">75</a>).—Eleven species of Hornbeams are native
to Asia and Europe and only 1 species is found in North America.
This is abundant in most parts of West Virginia.</p>

<p><b>Betula</b>.—This genus comprises 25 known species of trees and 10
species of shrubs. About 15 of these are native to North America<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">17</span>
and 3 to West Virginia. Besides our native species the Gray Birch
(<i>Betula populifolia</i>, Marsh.) and varieties of White Birch (<i>Betula alba</i>,

<h2 id="FAGACEAETHE_BEECH_FAMILY">FAGACEAE—THE BEECH FAMILY</h2>


<p>There are 6 genera and about 400 species of trees and shrubs
belonging to the Beech family of which 5 genera and about 60 species
are native to North America. Fourteen species of Oaks, 2 species
of Chestnuts, and 1 species of Beech occur in West Virginia.</p>

<p>This large family is second in importance only to the Pine family
and in some respects surpasses it. Nearly all its members, especially
the various kinds of oaks, produce wood of superior quality and
adapted to a great variety of uses.</p>

<p><b>Fagus</b>, (page <a href="#Page_83">83</a>).—This genus comprises, in the world, 5 species,
only 1 of which is found native in America. The others are
Asiatic and European species. The European Beech (<i>Fagus sylvatica</i>,
L.), and its varieties having purple leaves, cut leaves or pendent
branches are often planted for ornamental purposes.</p>

<p><b>Castanea</b>, (pp. <a href="#Page_85">85</a>, <a href="#Page_87">87</a>).—Of the 5 or more species of chestnuts
belonging to this genus, none is found in the western part of North
America and 3 species are native to the eastern part of the United
States. <i>Castanea alnifolia</i>, Nutt., is a shrub found in the southern
Atlantic states. The European Chestnut (<i>Castanea sativa</i>), the Japanese
Chestnut (<i>Castanea Japonica</i>) and the Chinese Chestnut (<i>Castanea
mollissima</i>) are all planted in this country for their nuts. The
Japanese and Chinese species are more or less resistant to the chestnut
bark disease and for this reason they and their hybrids with
our native species are likely to receive much attention from nut-growers.
The common Chestnut and the Chinquapin, both of which
are natives of West Virginia, may be exterminated by the disease
mentioned above.</p>

<p><b>Quercus</b>.—The Oak genus comprises 300 known species in the
world. Of these about 55 are indigenous to North America and 14
to West Virginia. The Oaks belong to two classes, namely, those
that mature their acorns in one season and those that mature them<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">18</span>
in two. The West Virginia species are grouped below according to
their classes:</p>

while others affirm there are many yet to be found. Millspaugh’s
Flora of West Virginia lists 22 species, and the writer has collected
several additional species that have been examined and identified by
Eggleston and others. Because the Thorns are of little commercial
importance and are very difficult to identify only 2 species are described
in this bulletin.</p>

<p><b>Prunus</b>.—This genus includes the Plums and Cherries. Of the

<p>The Olive family comprises about 20 genera with 500 species distributed
principally in the northern hemisphere. In North America
there are 5 genera with 20 species and in West Virginia 2 genera with
4 species. The Olive Tree (<i>Olea Europaea</i>, L.), which produces the
olives used for food, belongs to this family. This tree has been introduced
into the southwestern part of the United States. The <i>Syringas</i>,
(Lilacs), <i>Forsythias</i>, and <i>Ligustrums</i> (Privets) are extensively planted
in this State for ornamental purposes and for hedges. The two
genera described below have representatives in West Virginia.</p>

<h2 id="WHITE_PINE">WHITE PINE</h2>

<p><b>Pinus strobus</b>, L.</p>


<p><b>Form</b>.—Height 50-100 feet, diameter 2-4 feet; trunk when in close
stands long, straight, and free from limbs; limbs arranged in whorls.</p>

<p><b>Leaves</b>.—Arranged in clusters of 5, slender, 3-sided mucronate,
3-5 inches long, blue-green when mature.</p>

<p><b>Flowers</b>.—May; monoecious; the staminate oval, light brown
one-third inch long, clustered at base of new growth; the pistillate
catkins in small groups or solitary along the new growth, cylindrical,
about ¼ inch long, pink.</p>

<p><b>Fruit</b>.—Cones maturing in autumn of second year, drooping,
cylindrical, often curved, 4-6 inches long, scales thin without spines;
seeds red-brown mottled with black spots, ¼ inch long with wings 1
inch long.</p>

<p><b>Bark</b>.—On young branches smooth, green, often with red tinge;
on old trunks thick, divided by shallow fissures into wide flat-topped
ridges covered with purplish scales.</p>

<p><b>Wood</b>.—Soft, weak, straight-grained, easily worked, not durable
in contact with the ground, light brown with whitish sapwood.</p>

<p><b>Range</b>.—Newfoundland and Manitoba to Pennsylvania, Indiana
and Iowa, and south along the Alleghany mountains to northern
Georgia.</p>

<p><b>Distribution in West Virginia</b>.—Originally abundant in parts of
Pocahontas, Greenbrier, Raleigh, and Tucker counties, and sparingly
distributed in all the counties east of the Alleghanies, and in Gilmer,
Jackson, Monongalia, Preston, Ritchie, Tyler, Wetzel, and Wirt
counties. Now becoming rare.</p>

<p><b>Habitat</b>.—Prefers fertile, well-drained soil, but will grow in all
soils and situations excepting swamps and dry wind-swept ridges.</p>

<p><b>Notes</b>.—White Pine is easily distinguished from all other native
species by the leaves which are in clusters of five. This tree is one
of the most valuable and beautiful of the conifers. Its wood is extensively
used for shingles, construction, cabinet work, woodenware,
matches, etc. As an ornamental tree it is especially attractive. A
fungous disease, the white pine blister rust, threatens to destroy
the species.</p>

<p><b>Notes</b>.—This is our only native pine having all the leaves in
bundles of three. It is of much less value than the White Pine but
wall often grow where other pines will not. and is resistant to fire.
Wood used chiefly for mine props, fuel, charcoal, boxes, crates, and
construction. Tar is sometimes made from this wood, and the resin-filled
knots and wood are excellent for kindling fires.</p>

<h2 id="BLACK_WILLOW">BLACK WILLOW</h2>

<p><b>Salix nigra</b>, Marsh.</p>


<p><b>Form</b>.—Height 30-50 feet, diameter 1-2 feet; trunk often crooked
or leaning; crown open with long straggling limbs.</p>

<p><b>Leaves</b>.—Alternate, simple, narrowly lanceolate, taper-pointed,
margins finely serrate, 3-6 inches long, ¼-¾ inch broad; large semicordate
stipules.</p>

<p><b>Flowers</b>.—March-April, before the leaves; dioecious; both kinds
of flowers borne in slender, hairy catkins, 1-3 inches long; calyx and
corolla wanting; scales yellow, with 3-6 stamens.</p>

<p><b>Fruit</b>.—A capsule ⅛ inch long, early splitting open and liberating
the hairy seeds which are carried about by the wind.</p>

<p><b>Bark</b>.—On twigs reddish-brown; on old trunks thick, and rough
with many broad connecting ridges, often becoming shaggy.</p>

<p><b>Wood</b>.—Light, soft, brittle, not durable, very dark colored with
light sapwood.</p>

<p><b>Range</b>.—New Brunswick south to Florida, west to Dakota,
Arizona and central California.</p>

<p><b>Distribution in West Virginia</b>.—A common tree along streams in
nearly all parts of the State.</p>

<p><b>Habitat</b>.—Banks of streams and pond borders.</p>

<p><b>Notes</b>.—This is the commonest and most easily recognized of
the willows. Its greatest value in West Virginia is probably the part
it plays in holding stream banks in place. The wood is sometimes
used for fuel and charcoal.</p>

<p><b>Distribution in West Virginia</b>.—Common, especially on the hillsides
and ridges east of the Alleghanies. Less frequent and scattered
in the central and western counties.</p>

<p><b>Habitat</b>.—Prefers rich, well-drained soils of open wooded hillsides.</p>

<p><b>Notes</b>.—This tree has very thick sapwood which is the most valuable
part of hickory wood. It is unsurpassed for handle material
and other uses where strength and elasticity are desired. The nut
kernels are of good quality but are small and hard to get. The pubescent
leaf petioles and the thick husks and thick-walled nuts form easy
marks for distinguishing this species from the common shell-bark.

<h2 id="BLACK_BIRCH">BLACK BIRCH</h2>

<p><b>Betula lenta</b>, L.</p>


<p><b>Form</b>.—Height 50-85 feet, diameter 2-4 feet; trunk long and clear
in dense growths; crown narrow and open.</p>

<p><b>Leaves</b>.—Alternate in pairs, simple, 3-4 inches long; ovate to oblong,
taper pointed, doubly serrate, dull dark green above, paler beneath;
petioles short, hairy, grooved above.</p>

<p><b>Flowers</b>.—April, before the leaves; monoecious; the staminate in
pendent yellowish catkins; the pistillate in shorter erect catkins.</p>

<p><b>Fruit</b>.—An oblong, cone-shaped strobile, 1-1½ inches long, erect,
3-lobed scales smooth; nutlets small, winged.</p>

<p><b>Bark</b>.—Very dark and broken into thick, irregular ridges and
plates; the young and inside bark having a sweet, wintergreen taste.</p>

<p><b>Wood</b>.—Heavy, hard, close-grained, dark reddish brown, with
light sapwood.</p>

<p><b>Range</b>.—Newfoundland to Illinois, Tennessee and Florida.</p>

<p><b>Distribution in West Virginia</b>.—Scattered locally through nearly
all parts of West Virginia.</p>

<p><b>Habitat</b>.—Grows in a variety of soils and exposures, but prefers
rich moist woodlands.</p>

<p><b>Notes</b>.—Black Birch is a widely-known tree and is highly valued
on account of its wood. The local names, Red Birch and Cherry
Birch refer to the appearance of the heartwood and the bark, and
Sweet Birch to the flavor of the bark. This tree can be distinguished
from Yellow Birch, which it most closely resembles, by its darker-colored
bark which does not peel off in loose flakes.</p>

purplish catkins; the pistillate in shorter, erect, greenish catkins.</p>

<p><b>Fruit</b>.—Cone-shaped strobiles, 1 inch long and erect, scales of
strobile downy on the back and edges; nut small, about as broad as
its wing.</p>

<p><b>Bark</b>.—Silvery yellow-gray, with thin, papery layers separating
and often curling at the edges giving the trunk a ragged appearance;
slightly aromatic, and bitter. Campers often use the loose outer bark
for starting camp fires in wet weather.</p>

<p><b>Wood</b>.—Heavy, strong, hard, close-grained light reddish-brown,
with nearly white sapwood.</p>

<p><b>Range</b>.—Newfoundland to Minnesota and south to North Carolina.</p>

<p><b>Distribution in West Virginia</b>.—Frequent, especially in mountain
sections, growing with spruce and hemlock; rare in low hilly parts of
the State and in the Eastern Panhandle; found along streams and in
other damp situations on the outskirts of its range.</p>

<p><b>Habitat</b>.—Moist fertile uplands and along streams.</p>

<p><b>Notes</b>.—This large birch is associated with other mountain
species such as Spruce, Hemlock, Black Cherry, and Black Birch. It
furnishes valuable lumber and is a rapid grower. The characteristic
appearance of the bark, described above, will prevent the confusion
of this tree with its close relative, the Black Birch.</p>

<p><b>Betula nigra</b>, L.</p>


<p><b>Form</b>.—Height, 50-90 feet, diameter, 1-3 feet; trunk usually
short, dividing into two or three large ascending limbs; crown irregular,
oblong.</p>

<p><b>Leaves</b>.—Alternate, simple, 1½ to 3 inches long, round-ovate,
acute, doubly serrate, sometimes cut or slightly lobed, deep green,
pale yellow-green beneath.</p>

<p><b>Flowers</b>.—April, before the leaves; monoecious; staminate
formed in the fall and remaining over winter as short aments, usually
in clusters of three and elongating in the spring to 2-3 inches; pistillate,
short, erect, situated on twigs with the staminate flowers and
back of them.</p>

<p><b>Fruit</b>.—Cylindrical strobile, 1-1½ inches long; 3-lobed scales of
strobile pubescent; nuts small, hairy, winged.</p>

banks of the following rivers: Williams, Gauley, Greenbrier, New,
Great Kanawha, Little Coal, Elk, Guyandot, Twelvepole, Big Sandy,
Little Kanawha, Potomac, Shenandoah, Great Cacapon.</p>

<p><b>Habitat</b>.—Banks of streams, occasionally on drier ground.</p>

<p><b>Notes</b>.—A common name of this species, River Birch, signifies
its preference for river borders as its habitat. While the tree is not
important it serves to hold stream banks from falling in and at the
same time adds much to the attractiveness of river scenery. The
bark and leaves lack the aroma of some of the other birches.</p>

<p><b>Habitat</b>.—Thrives in most places in West Virginia, but is less
frequently seen on limestone soils and in swampy places.</p>

<p><b>Notes</b>.—The Chestnut tree is prized for its lumber, its nuts, its
tannin, and for its numerous uses, especially on the farm. It is a
very rapid grower, and sprouts freely from the base of the stump when
cut down. A disease known as chestnut blight has entered the
State and threatens to exterminate this tree.</p>

<p><b>Distribution in West Virginia</b>.—Not widely distributed but common
in some sections. Observed in the following counties: Mercer,
Wyoming, Summers, Fayette, Logan, and Boone. Reported also
from Wayne, Monroe, Mingo, Braxton, Gilmer, Pendleton, Greenbrier,
Grant and Nicholas counties.</p>

<p><b>Habitat</b>.—Dry slopes and flats and stream borders.</p>

<p><b>Notes</b>.—This species is usually a shrub in West Virginia, often
bearing fruit when only a few feet high. Several trees observed south
of the Kanawha River were well-formed, 20-25 feet tall, and with
straight trunks 6-8 inches in diameter. The Chinquapin is chiefly
prized on account of its nuts. It is susceptible to the attack of
chestnut blight and may eventually be killed out by this disease.</p>

<p><b>Notes</b>.—The Post Oak in winter may easily be mistaken for a
White Oak, but in summer and fall the small acorns and the peculiar
lobing of the leaves assist the student in distinguishing it from other
species. It is not commercially important but should be encouraged
to grow on account of the superior lasting qualities of the wood when
used for fence posts or otherwise in contact with the soil.</p>

rounded open crown.</p>

<p><b>Leaves</b>.—Alternate, simple, 5-9 inches long, with 5-7 toothed,
bristle-tipped lobes, becoming narrower outward from rounded sinuses,
thin and firm, smooth, lusterless dark green above, paler
beneath.</p>

<p><b>Flowers</b>.—May, with the leaves; monoecious; the staminate flowers
in long hairy catkins, the pistillate on short smooth stalks.</p>

<p><b>Fruit</b>.—Acorns maturing the second autumn after the flowers;
cup shallow, saucer-shaped, enclosing only the base of the nut; scales
closely-appressed and somewhat glossy; nut oblong-ovoid, 1 inch
long; kernel white, bitter.</p>

<p><b>Bark</b>.—Rough with long fissures and flat-topped ridges, gray
brown, inner bark light red, not bitter.</p>

<p><b>Wood</b>.—Heavy, hard, strong, close-grained, light red-brown.</p>

<p><b>Range</b>.—Southern Canada and Minnesota to Florida and Texas.</p>

<p><b>Distribution in West Virginia</b>.—A common tree in all parts of
the State. Most abundant and of superior size and quality in the high
hilly and mountain sections.</p>

<p><b>Habitat</b>.—Rich loamy or gravelly soils of bottom lands, slopes
and ridges.</p>

<p><b>Notes</b>.—The Red Oak is most frequently confused with the Black
Oak from which it can be distinguished by the light red inner bark,
the shallow-cupped acorns and the dull green leaves. This oak is
extensively sawed into lumber which is easily worked and capable
of a fine finish for furniture and interior work. As a tree for the park
or lawn there are few which surpass it.</p>

<p><b>Quercus palustris</b>, Michx.</p>


<p><b>Form</b>.—Height 50-75 feet, diameter 2-3 feet; trunk usually
straight and bearing a conic, well-shaped crown, lower limbs usually
drooping and curving upward at the tips.</p>

<p><b>Leaves</b>.—Alternate, simple, much smaller than those of the Red
Oak, with 3-7, coarse-toothed, bristle-tipped lobes, with rounded
sinuses; dark green and shining above, pale below, and smooth except
for bunches of brownish tomentum in the axils of the principal veins.</p>

<p><b>Flowers</b>.—Appear with the leaves; monoecious; staminate flowers
in catkins 2-3 inches long; pistillate short-stalked and with red
styles.</p>

<p><b>Fruit</b>.—Acorns maturing in autumn of second year after the
flowers; cup thin, shallow, about ½ inch across, enclosing about ¼
of the nut; kernel yellowish, bitter.</p>

<p><b>Bark</b>.—Not as rough as that of most of the oaks, but with shallow
fissures and broad flat ridges.</p>

<p><b>Wood</b>.—Heavy, hard, strong, light-brown.</p>

<p><b>Range</b>.—Massachusetts and Michigan to Virginia, Tennessee and
Oklahoma.</p>

<p><b>Distribution in West Virginia</b>.—Not a common tree. Plentiful
near Princeton, Mercer County, and less common in Hardy and Morgan
counties; doubtless growing locally in most of the counties south
of the Great Kanawha River.</p>

<p><b>Habitat</b>.—Prefers low ground along streams and borders of
swamps.</p>

<p><b>Notes</b>.—Pin Oak leaves resemble those of Scarlet Oak, but the
appearance of the whole tree is quite different from it. The drooping
lower branches and the location of the tree most readily distinguish
it, and a comparison of its small acorns with the large acorns of the
Scarlet Oak will serve to separate the two species. It is unexcelled
as a tree for parks where it grows with a straight trunk and beautiful
rounded crown.</p>

<p><b>Habitat</b>.—Grows best on moist, rich land, but is found in a variety
of soils.</p>

<p><b>Notes</b>.—Sugar Berry and Hoop Ash are two common local names
of this species. In some places along the Ohio River the tree grows
to a fairly large size with a long clear trunk; in the eastern part of
the State it is usually small and scrubby. The tree is most easily distinguished
by its peculiar warty bark and by the witches’ brooms
which are usually present. The wood is often sold as Ash and is used
for cheap furniture, cooperage, crates, boxes, agricultural implements,
etc. The very small shrubby trees found in the Eastern part of the
State should probably be classed as Variety <i>pumila</i>, Muhl.</p>

<p><b>Prunus serotina</b>, Ehrh.</p>


<p><b>Form</b>.—Height 60-100 feet, diameter 2-5 feet; trunk when in close
stands tall and straight, bearing a rather open irregularly-oblong
crown.</p>

<p><b>Leaves</b>.—Alternate, simple, lanceolate-oblong, taper-pointed, 2-5
inches long, thickish, serrate-crenate, with incurved teeth, smooth,
dark green above, paler beneath.</p>

<p><b>Flowers</b>.—May-June; perfect; ¼ inch wide, white arranged in
drooping many-flowered racemes.</p>

<p><b>Fruit</b>.—Matures in late summer and persists for two or three
months; a nearly black drupe, in drooping clusters, one-third-½ inch
thick, with purplish juicy slightly bitter edible flesh.</p>

<p><b>Bark</b>.—On old trunks roughened by thick, blackish, irregular
plates; inner bark aromatic, bitter.</p>

<p><b>Wood</b>.—Light, strong, close-grained, light reddish brown, with
thin yellowish sapwood.</p>

<p><b>Range</b>.—Nova Scotia to Florida, west to Dakota and Arizona.</p>

<p><b>Distribution in West Virginia</b>.—A common timber tree in the
more mountainous parts of the State; once plentiful on rich soils of
upland flats and stream valleys of Tucker, Randolph, Barbour, Webster,
Nicholas, Pocahontas, Greenbrier, and Monroe counties. Smaller
and less common in most other sections.</p>

<p><b>Habitat</b>.—Thrives best in rich, loose soils of slopes and mountain
flats.</p>

<p><b>Notes</b>.—This tree, which is usually called Wild Cherry, produces
excellent lumber for furniture, and interior finish. It can be distinguished
from the Choke Cherry, which it most closely resembles,
by its larger size, longer narrower leaves, and rougher bark. Wild
cherry trees large enough for lumber are now becoming scarce.</p>

the lobes taper-pointed, glabrous and dark green above, somewhat
downy beneath, petioles long and slender.</p>

<p><b>Flowers</b>.—May-June; polygamo-monoecious; small, yellow-green,
arranged in upright, dense, somewhat compound racemes.</p>

<p><b>Fruit</b>.—Early autumn; small, paired samaras, red, turning brown
and drooping when mature, in racemose clusters.</p>

<p><b>Bark</b>.—Nearly smooth, light brown, thin; twigs reddish, slightly
hairy.</p>

<p><b>Wood</b>.—Light, soft, close-grained, light brown, with thick sapwood.</p>

<p><b>Range</b>.—Newfoundland and Labrador, south to Georgia and west
to Minnesota.</p>

<p><b>Distribution in West Virginia</b>.—Common in mountainous sections
and sometimes occurring at low elevations adjacent to the
mountains. Found growing from elevation 850 feet, in Monongalia
County, to elevation 4,800 feet, in Pendleton County.</p>

<p><b>Habitat</b>.—Damp mountain forests, along streams and on rocky
slopes; thrives in the shade of other trees.</p>

<p><b>Notes</b>.—The Mountain Maple is often seen fruiting when only
4 or 5 feet high, but it frequently reaches tree size in favorable locations.
The wood is not found on the market. This species is one of
the most ornamental of the maples and should be planted more generally.
The erect flower spikes, small red fruits, reddish twigs, and
coarse-toothed leaves are characters that distinguish it from other
maples.</p>

other species are disappearing. Interior finish, furniture, shoe-lasts
and cross-ties are among the common uses of this wood. It is the
principal species from which maple syrup and sugar are made, and
one of the very best trees for ornamental planting.</p>

for many purposes about the farm and is also manufactured into
shuttles, wedges, golf-stick heads, engravers’ blocks, brush blocks,
tool handles and for turnery. As an ornamental tree it beautifies the
native woods or the lawn by its clusters of white-bracted flowers, and
later in the season by its scarlet fruits.</p>

States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily

contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
